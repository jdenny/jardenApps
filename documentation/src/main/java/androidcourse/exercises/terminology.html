<tr><td>Action Bar</td><td>Area at the top of each screen to expose important
 actions and navigations, e.g. New, Search.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Activity</td><td>Android class that manages a single user screen</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADB</td><td>Android Debug Bridge; terminal emulator: adb shell</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADT</td><td>Android Development Tools: plug-in for Eclipse</td></tr>
<tr><td>APK</td><td>Application PacKage, an archive file of the complete application,
	with an .apk suffix; it contains code, data and resources;
	similar to Java .jar file (same format as .zip)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Application Component</td><td>basic building block of an app;
	entry point for app;
	4 types of component: Activity, Service, Content Provider,
	Broadcast Receiver</td></tr>
<tr><td>ARM</td><td>Processor architecture from ARM Holdings, used
	in most smartphones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ART</td><td>Android Runtime; In Lollipop, the Dalvik Virtual
	Machine is completely replaced by ART. ART has many advantages over
	Dalvik VM such as AOT (Ahead Of Time) compilation and improved garbage
	collection which boost 	the performance of apps significantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Broadcast Receiver</td><td>component that responds to system-wide broadcast
	announcements e.g. screen turned off, battery low, picture captured;
	broadcast delivered as an Intent</td></tr>
<tr><td>Component</td><td>see Application Component</td></tr>
<tr><td>Content Provider</td><td>component that manages a shared set
	of application data; data may be held, for example, in a file,
	SQLite DB, or web</td></tr>
<tr><td>Context</td><td>Interface to global information about an application
	environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dalvik</td><td>virtual machine for Android;
	Java source -> compile -> Dalvik executable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dex</td><td>Dalvik Executable format. Similar to .jar file,
	a .dex file is used to hold a set of class definitions, but the
	classes are in a format suitable for Dalvik VM rather than Java VM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DDMS</td><td>Dalvik Debug Monitor Server</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dialog</td><td>A dialog is a small window that prompts the user

	a fragment can be re-used in other activities</td></tr>
<tr><td>Intent</td><td>description of an operation to be performed
	or description of results of said operation</td></tr>
<tr><td>NDK</td><td>Native Development Kit; used to invoke C/C++ from Android</td></tr>
<tr><td>OAT</td><td>Runtime executable file (a type of ELF - Executable and Linkable
	Format) produced from Dex file by dex2oat for the Android Runtime
	(ART)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Odex</td><td>Optimized Dalvik EXecutable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Platform-tools</td><td>see \Program Files\Android\android-sdk\tools,
	e.g. emulators, sqlite3, sdkController</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDK</td><td>Software Development Kit</td></tr>
<tr><td>Service</td><td>component that runs in background to perform
	long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes;
	no user interface</td></tr>
<tr><td>Support Libraries</td><td>to allow an app to use new features
	on old devices; e.g. ActionBar introduced at Android 3.0 (API 11);
	support-v7 is used to run on devices as early as Android 2.1 (API 7).
	Fragment introduced at Android 3.0 (API 11); support-v4 is used to
	run on devices as early as Android 1.6 (API 4).</td></tr>
