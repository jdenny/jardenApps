<p>Add callback method <code>onBackPressed()</code> to ExplorerActivity.
Add log message to this method. Make sure you call the super-class version.</p>

<p>Run the app to confirm the log message appears.</p>

<p>Save the explorerFragment in an instance variable, e.g. in
<code>ExplorerActivity.onCreate()</code>:</p><pre>
this.fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
this.explorerFragment =
    (ExplorerFragment) this.fragmentManager.findFragmentById(
    R.id.explorerFragment);</pre>
Now, still in <code>ExplorerActivity</code>, provide  a proper implementation of
<code>onBackPressed()</code>. Note that we could put all the logic in this
activity, but it's better to let <code>ExplorerFragment</code> handle the logic
for navigating the file store, so we notify the fragment that the
back button has been pressed.<pre>
@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) Log.d(TAG, "onBackPressed()");
    boolean dealtWith = explorerFragment.onBackPressed();
    if (!dealtWith) super.onBackPressed();
}
</pre>

<p>Now add the following method to <code>ExplorerFragment</code><pre>
/**
 * @return true if back button dealt with
 */
public boolean onBackPressed() {
    if (currentDirectory != null) {
        currentDirectory = currentDirectory.getParentFile();
    }
    if (currentDirectory != null) {
        showCurrentDirectory();
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Accessing External Storage</h3>
<p>To access external storage of the device, we can declare the
permission in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>. When a user installs
your app, Android will list the permissions you have requested. Before
API level 19, this permission is not necessary.</p>

<pre>
&lt;manifest ...>
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    ...
&lt;/manifest>
</pre>

<h3>Coping With Screen Rotation</h3>
Navigate to a sub-directory in Explorer. Now rotate the screen. Does it return
to the root directory? If we look at the life-cycle messages in the log, we
can see that rotating the device destroys both the Activity and the Fragment.
This is because we may well have different layout files for portrait and 
landscape, so Android destroys the Activity and all its Fragments, and
runs <code>Activity.onCreate()</code>, and when a Fragment is included in
the Activity layout, calls <code>Fragment.onCreate()</code> and
<code>Fragment.onCreateView()</code>.
This isn't always what we want, so there is a
method we can call in Fragment.onCreate():<pre>
setRetainInstance(true);
</pre>
This doesn't affect the Activity, but does mean that for the Fragment,
<code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onDestroy()</code> will not be called on
a configuration change - which is why we set the initial value of
currentDirectory in <code>onCreate()</code>. But onCreateView() will still
be called, so the view can be created from different resources.</p>

<p>With <code>setRetainInstance(true)</code> the current directory should now
be preserved when we rotate the phone. But what about preserving state within
the activity? If the activity is being re-created as a result of a configuration
change, or a pause while we receive a phone call, the UI state is preserved
in a Bundle which is passed to <code>onCreate()</code>. We don't have any state
to preserve yet, but we will later, when we add more fragments.

<p>Re-run Explorer to check that the current directory is now be preserved during
screen rotations, and the <i>back</i> button still works.</p>
