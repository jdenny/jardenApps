to do next:
	design patterns: produce DAO class that gets data for JUnit;
		initially hard-coded, then from properties, file or DB
		explain object to db mapping; with annotations, basis for Hibernate
		perhaps produce simple version of oo -> rdb mapping using @?
		see demo.database.ProductDAO
	finish off InterfaceLab.html: what should it do? build a solution
	Inner Classes: only demo so far
	add images to QuizSwing
	change console to different style
	Make it easier for students to do a part of the chat project: networking, thread-
	handling or Swing.
	Lab notes for Quiz: when we've done with QuizGui, turn it into a jar file,
	with a start class, so that it can be double-clicked from explorer.
	note: coding works, good; but what about:
		unit-testing, documentation, security, fail-over (recover from errors)?

Advanced topics, where we should at least include a demo
	Encoding different character sets
		see jarden.quiz.QuizCache in JardenAppLib.
	Regular expressions
ChatGUI
	add new button: Refresh, which sends a multicast of it's address
	on receiving multicast announcement, add if not in list, then
	reply with unicast

Teaching style (12 July 2012):
	introduce 3 projects: draw, quiz, chat; give demos
		at some point demo of QuizMaze (mention Java Web Start)
		each project split into components (model, view, controller?)
		students optionally choose a project, and build individual components
			as they are able, as background activity
			provide instructions for building each project
	do OOP, including inheritance, as soon as possible
	for each module
		show slides
		lab with recipe
		similar lab without recipe; both these labs free-standing
		review 2nd lab, against harder bits of slides
		discuss patterns used, and why (this means reading
			"effective java" and applying it!)
		quiz for certification; may be too much to cover in class
			see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/QandE/generics-questions.html
