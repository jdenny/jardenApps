<p><a href='ExerciseContents.html'>Back to Exercise List</a></p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
This is a project to ask quiz questions and check the supplied answers. The questions can
be of various types:<ul>
	<li>generated mathematics questions, e.g. arithmetic, algebra, series</li>
	<li>pre-defined text-based questions; the questions and answers can be
	obtained from various sources, e.g. hard-coded in the program, or held in a
	file or on a database.</li>
</ul>
The project is well suited to an object-oriented design, as all these question-types
share certain data and methods, but also have variations. The project should illustrate
two basic advantages of developing in an object-oriented style:<ul>
	<li>new question types can be added without affecting existing code;</li>
	<li>new functionality - e.g. repeating questions incorrectly answered - can be
	added in a single superclass, and automatically incorporated into all the
	subclasses.</li>
</ul>

<a id="ArithmeticClass"></a>
<h4>Arithmetic Class</h4><ul>
	<li>create class Arithmetic with method <code>main()</code></li>
	<li>generate 2 random integers</li>
	<li>prompt user to supply sum of 2 integers, e.g.<br/>
		5 + 3 =</li>
	<li>output supplied answer plus correct answer, e.g.<br/>
		your answer: 8; correct answer: 8</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample Solution: quiz1.Arithmetic</p>

<a id="ArithmeticClass2"></a>
<h4>Revised Arithmetic class</h4>
Update Arithmetic class as follows<ul>
	<li>tell user if right; if wrong print correct answer</li>
	<li>Test the code so far</li>
	<li>ask if user wants another; repeat while user types in "y" or "yes"</li>
	<li>Test the code so far</li>
	<li>Now extend arithmetic quiz to include other arithmetic operations: - * /<ul>
	<li>generate random operator index (i.e. number from 1 to 4, to correspond to 4
	 arithmetic operators +, -, *, /)</li>
	<li>prompts should now be something like:<br/>
	5 * 4 =<br/>
	12 / 4 =</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Sample Solution: quiz1.Arithmetic2</p>

<a id="ArithmeticQuiz"></a>
<h4>ArithmeticQuiz Class</h4>
Create class ArithmeticQuiz, with public methods:<pre>
String getNextQuestion()
String getCurrentQuestion()
boolean isCorrect(int answer)
String getAnswer()</pre>
base these methods on the code in Arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Create a class Main which:<ul>
	<li>creates an object of type ArithmeticQuiz, and invokes its methods</li>
	<li>includes the input/output code previously used in Arithmetic</li>
</ul>
Test that Main works the same as Arithmetic.<br/>

<a id="CapitalsQuiz"></a>
<h4>CapitalsQuiz Class</h4>

<p>Define class CapitalsQuiz, which asks the user to supply the capital of a country,
where the names of the countries and capitals are held in 2 arrays. E.g. the 2 arrays
could contain:</p><code>
<b>Countries</b><br/>
"Norway", "England", "France", "Italy", "Sweden", "Denmark", "Finland",
"Netherlands", "Germany", "Spain", "Ireland", "Belgium", "Greece", "Portugal"<br>
<b>Capitals</b><br/>
"Oslo", "London", "Paris", "Rome", "Stockholm", "Copenhagen", "Helsinki",
"Amsterdam", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Dublin", "Brussels", "Athens", "Lisbon"
</code>
<p>Provide similar methods as for ArithmeticQuiz, except that isCorrect() should take
a parameter of type String, rather than int.</p>

<p>Note: either serially go through all the elements of the arrays, or randomly choose
an index each time.</p>

<p>Add a <code>main()</code> method in CapitalsQuiz, which creates an object of
type CapitalsQuiz and invokes its methods, similar to the code previously used
in class Main.</p>

<p>Test CapitalsQuiz</p>

<p>Sample Solution: quiz2.CapitalsQuiz</p>

<a id="Inheritance"></a>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>

<p>Separate CapitalsQuiz into two classes: Quiz and CapitalsQuiz (subclass of
Quiz), so that CapitalsQuiz contains only 1 method, <code>getNextQuestion()</code>,
which overrides the abstract method in Quiz. All the other methods become part of
Quiz. Also, add the following public method to Quiz:<pre>
void setQuestionAnswer(String question, String answer)</pre>
which is called from CapitalsQuiz.getNextQuestion</p>

<p>Check CapitalsQuiz still works.</p>

<p>Define ArithmeticQuiz as a subclass of Quiz</p><ul>
	<li>As with CapitalsQuiz, we override the abstract method <code>getNextQuestion()</code>.</li>
	<li>We also have to cater for the fact that the answer to this quiz is an integer,
	 rather than a string. There are a number of ways of coping with this, and this
	 is our suggestion:<ul>
	<li>in Quiz, add 2 new methods:<pre>
/**
 * save the answer as corectIntAnswer:int,
 * plus convert it to a string and save as
 * correctAnswer:String
 */
setQuestionAnswer(String question, int answer)
boolean isCorrect(int answer)</pre></li>
	<li>in ArithmeticQuiz override the method <code>isCorrect(String answer)</code><br>
	to convert answer to a string, and call the superclass method isCorrect(int)</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<p>In the <code>main()</code> method of class Main, allow the user to choose between
the two types of quiz. Depending on the choice, create a Quiz object of
the appropriate class; from then on the code should be the same for both
types of Quiz (or indeed any other type of Quiz that we will later invent).</p>

<p>Optional: keep a track of how many right and wrong answers, and display
this at the end of the questions.</p>

<a id="isCorrect"></a>
<h4>Object Orientation at Work in Quiz Classes</h4>

<p>So far, we have had some practice with the grammar of defining classes,
but you may be wondering what we have gained by adopting an 
object-oriented design. When we pass an object of type Quiz to
askQuestions, we can pass an object of any subclass of Quiz.
Effectively we can invent new types of questions (e.g. algebra,
multi-choice) and slot them into the infrastructure we have built,
without having to change the existing classes. Also, if we extend
the functionality in class Quiz, it is automatically inherited by
the subclasses. Let's try one such extension.</p>

<p>Update the method <code>isCorrect</code> within base class Quiz, to return
3 possible values:<ul>
	<li>1: correct</li>
	<li>0: incorrect</li>
	<li>-1: fail, i.e. 3 wrong attempts at the same question</li>
</ul>
You will also need to update <code>setQuestionAnswer()</code> to reset the
number of attempts at answering the question.

<p>Now update the loop where you ask questions to check the return value as
follows:<ul>
	<li>correct: go on to next question</li>
	<li>incorrect: prompt the user to try again with the same question</li>
	<li>fail: tell the user the correct answer, and go to the next question</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes should be inherited by all the sub-classes. Test by running
Arithmetic Quiz and Capitals Quiz.</p>

<a id="levels"></a>
<h4>Right-first-time enhancement to Quiz Classes</h4>

<p>For text-based questions: if right first time, remove question from set.
For generated mathematical questions: if 3 consecutive answers right
first time then increment difficulty level.</p>

An outline implementation of both cases is shown below:<ul>
	<li>in Quiz class:<ul>
		<li>in constructor: set <code>level</code> to 1, and
		 	<code>consecutiveRights</code> to 0</li>
	    <li>define a new method <code>notifyRightFirstTime()</code> which
			increments <code>consecutiveRights</code>;
			if <code>consecutiveRights</code>
			now greater than 2 then increment <code>level</code> and reset
			<code>consecutiveRights</code> to 0</li>
	    <li>in <code>isCorrect()</code> method:
	        if right on first attempt, call <code>notifyRightFirstTime</code><br/>
	        if wrong, reset <code>consecutiveRights</code> to 0</li>
	    <li>define new method <code>getMaxInt()</code>:
	        return <code>baseMax * (1.2 ** level)</code> as an integer;
	        default value of <code>baseMax</code> is 20; the library method
	        <code>Math.pow()</code> can be used to calculate a power.</li></ul>

	<li>in CapitalsQuiz class:
    define new method <code>notifyRightFirstTime()</code> to override base
    class: delete current entry in question list</li>

	<li>in Arithmetic class:
    at beginning of <code>getNextQuestion()</code>,
        call superclass method <code>getMaxInt()</code> to get maximum based
        on level</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample solution in package quiz</p>

<a id="file"></a>
<h4>Quiz from File</h4>
Define class FileQuiz, which gets its questions and answers from a text file
or a properties file. The name of the file is passed as a parameter to the
FileQuiz constructor.

<h4>Random order for text-based questions</h4>

<p>Update text-based Quiz types to randomise the order of the questions. This applies,
to CapitalsQuiz and FileQuiz.</p>

<a id="database"></a>
<h4>Quiz from Database</h4>
Define class DBQuiz, which gets its questions and answers from database ENGSPA.
The name of the CATEGORY is passed as a parameter to the DBQuiz constructor.
