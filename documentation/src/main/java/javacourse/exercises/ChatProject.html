<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>This is quite an ambitious project, requiring substantial use of TCP/IP
sockets and datagrams, thread handling, and Swing.</p>

<p>The requirement is to allow each user to send each other messages over
a local area network (LAN). This is similar in principle to Google chat and the
like, except this only works locally, and there is no central server acting as a
hub, which means messages go directly from the sender to the receiver.</p>

<p>If you want to concentrate on the business logic rather than the user
interface, we have provided a Swing front-end - see
chat.swing.ChatSwing. If you use our ChatSwing, you need to build a class
that implements chat.swing.ChatNetIF. When you receive a 'connect' message
(see below) create
a new User object, and pass this to ChatSwing.addUser(). When you receive
any other message, pass this to ChatSwing.showMessage().</p>

<h4>Logical steps</h4><ul>
	<li>Send simple message from client to server; server sends a reply. This could
	be done either with a Datagram or a Socket:<ul>
		<li>Datagram: not reliable, but less resources</li>
		<li>Socket: reliable, but more resources.</li></ul>
	In reality, sockets hold open a connection at each end of the conversation,
	and socket classes at each end
	retry messages if no acknowledgement received. Datagram is like sending
	letters to each other; Socket is more like a telephone call, so that the
	line is busy, even if neither party happens to be talking.</li>

	<li>Set up a simple user interface for both ends of the conversation; could be
	using standard input/output; or better to use Swing; this makes it easier for
	each party to type in the message to be sent, and select a destination.</li>

	<li>As each user joins the conversation, add to the group, either manually
	or automatically<ul>
		<li>manual: verbally tell the others your IP address and listen port;
		they add that user to the group, using a provided interface.</li>
		<li>automatic: multicast your IP address and listen port. This requires
		an extra thread listening to multicast broadcasts on a certain pre-agreed
		port.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Suggested Implementation</h4>
<ul>
	<li>ChatNet will announce its presence by constructing a connect-message containing
	user name, host name and port, e.g.<br/><code>
			connect::name=John::host=192.168.2.1::port=8002</code><br/>
	and sending this as a multicast message to address 230.0.0.1, port 9002</li>
	<li>ChatNet will continue listening to multicast messages on this address
	plus it will listen to Datagrams sent to its own host address,
	by default on port 8002.</li>
	<li>Chat users can thus send messages to individual users, on their
	announced address or send messages to all users on the multicast address.</li>
	<li>On receiving a connect message from a new user, ChatNet will send a connect
	message back, using unicast.</li>
</ul>
<b>Notes</b><ul>
	<li>See classes in demo.net for examples of sending and receiving
	datagrams, using point-to-point or multicast</li>
	<li>multicast addresses are in the range 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255</li>
	<li>Note2: must make sure unicast listening thread is running before we send our
	multicast connect message, or else we won't get the returning connect. Order of
	events is:<ol>
		<li>unicast listening thread running</li>
		<li>multicast listening thread runing</li>
		<li>send multicast connect message</li>
	</ol>
</li></ul>
