<h3>Define Product Class - team exercise</h3>
<p>The instructor will demonstrate how to define a class, but with the help of all
the students. Please feel free to contribute, and correct his 'deliberate' errors.
</p>

<p>Define a class to hold the part number, description and price of a product.
Provide a constructor, a method to return the variables concatenated into a
String, and a method to return the price of the product. Within <code>main()</code>,
invoke the product methods and print out the returned values.</p>

<p>Sample Solution: solution.Product</p>

<h3>Define SalesUnit Class</h3>
<p>The exercises from this and the following two chapters all develop a project to keep
track of sales figures for sales people reporting to sales teams. At each stage, build on
your solution to the previous exercise, or if you are falling behind, use the sample
solution from the previous exercise.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a file SalesUnit.java, containing public class SalesUnit,
which defines someone or something (i.e. a sales person or a sales team) that sells
products, hopefully for a profit. SalesUnit should contain the following members.

<table border="1" >
<tr><td><code>SalesUnit</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>String name<br/>
	double salesTarget</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>SalesUnit(String name, double salesTarget)<br/>
	String getName()<br/>
	double getSalesTarget()<br/>
	String toString()</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p><code>getName()</code> returns the name of the SalesUnit<br/>
<code>getSalesTarget()</code> (hopefully you get the idea by now)<br/>
<code>toString()</code> returns a String made from concatenating the name and 
salesTarget</p>

<p>Create a file called SalesTest.java, containing a public class SalesTest, which in
turn has a method <code>main()</code>. In <code>main()</code>, create several
SalesUnit objects, and invoke the methods for these objects.</p>

<p>Also in <code>main()</code>, test out the effects of using the modifiers private
and public on variables and methods.</p>
</li>

<li>Further develop the SalesUnit class:<ul>
<li>check that the salesTarget is not less than 1000</li>
<li>hold the date the object was created; today's date can be obtained
	using something like:<br/>
	<code>java.util.Date today = new java.util.Date();</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Sample solution in package sales1</p>
