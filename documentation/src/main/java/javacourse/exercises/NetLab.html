<p>Run the demo programs in demo.net. Note that when you
have several programs running concurrently, they each have
a standard output window, but they are all contained in console.
In the console window, there is an icon near the top right
"Display Selected Console" that gives you a drop down list
of consoles.<ul>
	<li>run ThreadedSocketServer</li>
	<li>run SimpleSocketClient; check the output on the 2 consoles</li>
	<li>optionally, update SimpleSocketClient so that it
	connects to someone else's Server;
	test this works</li>
	<li>stop any running socket server</li>
	<li>run ReceiveDatagram</li>
	<li>run SendDatagram; send messages, and check they
	are received by ReceiveDatagram. Try sending messages
	to someone else's server, by supplying the host name 
	on the GUI</li>
	<li>stop any running servers you have</li>
	<li>run MulticastSendReceive; send messages;
	they should be received by all students on network
	who are also running this program.</li>
	<li>if you are hotly interested in writing network
	applications in Java, have a go at the
	<a href='ChatProject.html'>Chat</a> project; if you
	are lukewarm interested in networks, run the sample
	solution, demo.net.ChatGUI</li>
</ul>
