<div class='banner'>OBJECT-ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING IN JAVA</div>

<h3>ABOUT THE COURSE</h3>
<p>This 5-day course offers an intensive introduction to Java,
with the goal of enabling participants to understand and utilise
the principles of object-orientated programming, so they may use
Java to solve real-world problems. Syntax and semantics are just
the beginning; the course enables students to appreciate the spirit
of Java, in order to obtain the full benefit of the powerful design
patterns encouraged by the language.</p>

<p>The course exercises are at two levels: step-by-step instructions
to cement the programming concepts just learnt; course projects, 
where we simply describe the requirements, and allow the student
to design and code a solution.
