<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>Modify your method which prints a compass direction - see 
<a href='MethodLab.html'>Methods</a> part 2, or solution.Methods
if you didn't complete this exercise. In the method,
throw an IllegalArgumentException if the value passed is invalid.
At this point don't try to catch the exception.
Test the code with some valid chars, then an invalid one. Run your code to
confirm an exception is thrown.</p>

<p>Now define a new exception called NoDirectionHomeException, which is a
subclass of Exception.
Throw NoDirectionHomeException instead of IllegalArgumentException. The
compiler should now tell you that you have to declare this exception
in the called method. Once you do that, the compiler should say you need to
handle the exception in the calling method. Wrap the call in a try-catch
block. Run your code to confirm that an exception is thrown and caught.</p>

<h4>Assertions</h4>

<p>Add an extra call to your method, with an invalid value,
and <code>assert</code> that an exception is thrown. To do this:<ul>
	<li>wrap the invalid call in a try-catch block</li>
	<li>after the call, add <code>assert false</code>, i.e. fail
		if the code reaches this point</li>
	<li>in the catch block, report that the exception was thrown
		as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <code>assert false</code> is not reached. Now, to prove
your code <b>would</b> pick up a programming error, introduce one by
passing a valid direction and expecting it to fail.
Don't forget to enable assertions!
