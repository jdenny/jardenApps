<p>Define an enum type for DayOfWeek (Sunday, Monday etc). List all the days of the week.
Add a method in enum to return the next day, e.g. <code>SUNDAY.getNext()</code>
would return MONDAY. Edit your list of all the days to also show the next day, e.g.
"if today is MONDAY, tomorrow is TUESDAY".</p>

<p>Define an enum type for Country, where each country also holds the name of its
capital. (No need to include all the countries of the world, as there are about 200,
and this is a course on Java, not Geography! A handfull will be sufficient.)
List all the countries you have defined, showing the name and capital.
Add methods: <code>String getCapital()</code> and
<code>boolean isCapital(String capital)</code>.
Test this out by prompting the user to supply the capital of each country,
and checking if the answer is correct.</p>
