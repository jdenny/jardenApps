<p>After each module, there are exercises, usually stand-alone, to let you
try out what was taught on the module. There is also a <b>Quiz</b> project, which
continues throughout the week, to allow you to reinforce the teaching points.
The instructions for this are rather less explicit, so you need to think a
bit more about design, and may need to look at the Java API. The Quiz project
is more of a background activity, to be done at your own pace.</p>

<p>As alternatives to Quiz, there are two other projects described, in case the
subject matter of one of them is nearer to your heart. <b>Draw</b> is focused
on building a graphical user interface which responds to mouse
movements and key presses, as well as the more basic button actions.
<b>Chat</b> is focused on networking using Sockets and Datagrams;
it also uses threads and Swing.</p>
