<div class='banner'>Java Programming Course - Draw Project</div>

<p><a href='ExerciseContents.html'>Back to Exercise List</a></p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Training materials for Object-Oriented design and programming often use as examples
drawing classes, e.g. Shape, Rectangle, Ellipse. This is because they well illustrate
the advantages of an Object-Oriented approach, and most people have come across and
probably used some kind of drawing package. This Java Programming course uses various
drawing classes in the slides.</p>

<p>What may not be clear from the slides is how these classes are used, which in
practice would be with some kind of user interface. So this project is largely an
exercise in Java's Swing user interface. Once this has been developed, it is easy
to see how new shape classes can be added to the application, with very little
impact on the user interface, other than adding a new shape type to the palette.</p>

<p>If you want to have a go at this, please feel free. If you prefer to see how we
have built a basic solution, run the class <code>jarden.draw.DrawingGUI</code>.</p>

<h4>Shape Class</h4><ul>
	<li>Define class MyShape, with following attributes<pre>
int x, y, width, height;
Color lineColour, fillColour;
String text;</pre></li>
	<li>Provide constructor, plus methods to access the attributes</li>
	<li>Provide a method to display the attribute values</li>
	<li>Create some MyShape objects, and display their attribute values</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample Solution: shape.MyShape</p>

<h4>Inheritance</h4>

<p>Define MyRectangle and MyEllipse as subclasses of MyShape.</p>

<h4>Polyporphism</h4>

<p>Define an array of MyShapes. Populated the array with different types of shape.
Invoke the <code>toString()</code> method of each shape in the array.</p>

<h4>User Interface</h4>

<p>Create a simple Swing user interface to draw the shapes you have defined.
See <code>demo.swing.ShapeSwing</code> to see how to draw basic shapes in a window.</p>

<h4>Possible enhancements to the Shape classes</h4>

<p>Other candidate shapes are MyLine, Disk (a vertical cylinder shape, used to
represent a computer disk).</p>

<p>If you are really ambitious, and keen to develop your Swing skills, provide the
means to create shapes with the user interface, instead of hard-coding them. You could
either use a mouse to click on one corner of the shape and drag to the opposite corner,
as done with most drawing programs, or allow the user to type in values for the various
fields. Our solution, in package jarden.draw, uses both.</p>
