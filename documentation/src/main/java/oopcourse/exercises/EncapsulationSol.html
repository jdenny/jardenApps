<p>All variables should be encapsulated!</p>

<p>Encapsulation provides 2 main advantages:<ul>
	<li>the methods that give access to the data can enforce validation
	rules, e.g. speed of plane cannot be negative; only authorised
	people can take money out of your bank account</li>
	<li>the implementation can change over time - the way the data is
	held and the rules for setting the data - without changing the program
	interface; this means we can change the implementation without changing
	the code that is using our class</li>
</ul>

<p>Some languages, e.g. Java, C++, have another level of visibility: protected.
Protected means the attribute is visible to subclasses. Some people think this
is a hack, a quick fix which comes back to bite you later.</p>

<p>Constant values (static final in Java) are often public. Examples of
constants in Quiz are:<ul>
	<li>prompts - 'What is the capital of {}?'</li>
	<li>public final static int BASE_MAX = 20<br/>
	default maximum value of operands in arithmetic questions</li>
	</ul>
