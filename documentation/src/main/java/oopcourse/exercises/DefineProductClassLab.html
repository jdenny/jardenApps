<h3>Define Product Class - team exercise</h3>
<p>The instructor will demonstrate how to define a class, but with the help of all
the students. Please feel free to contribute, and correct his 'deliberate' errors.
The objective is to see the whole process of coding and running a class within
a integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse.

Provide a constructor, a method to return the variables concatenated into a
String, and a method to return the price of the product. Within <code>main()</code>,
invoke the product methods and print out the returned values.</p>
