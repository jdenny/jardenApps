<h3>Redesign an existing application in an Object-Oriented way</h3>

<p>Two programs have been written so far, and the outline of their <b>current logic</b> is as follows:<ul>
<li>arithmetic quiz<pre>
loop until user quits:
	get 2 random numbers, a, b (from 1 to 10)
	get random operator: +, -, *, /
	prompt for user input: what is &lt;a> &lt;op> &lt;b>?
	test input against correct answer
	if wrong, print correct answer</pre></li>
<li>text-based quiz<pre>
define list of question/answer pairs (hard-coded in program)
loop until end of list or user quits:
	prompt user with next question
	test input against correct answer
	if wrong, print correct answer</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The analysts have identified the following <b>requirements</b> to extend the application:<ul>
<li>user interface is separate from business logic
(so we can plug in different user interfaces: command-line, windows, web browser)</li>
<li>easy to plug in different quiz types; generated: arithmetic, algebra, series,
word anagrams; pre-defined questions/answers, read from file or database</li>
<li>give the user 3 attempts to get the right answer; if fails after 3 attempts,
 reveal the answer</li>
<li>for generated questions (e.g. maths):<ul>
	<li>if user gets 3 consecutive questions right on first attempt then increase level
	 of difficulty</li></ul></li>
<li>for pre-defined questions (e.g. general knowledge):<ul>
	<li>if doesn't get it right first time, ask the same question again later</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise - specify classes</h3>
<p>Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to decide what classes are required.
Then, for each class, what attributes - data and functions - are required.</p>

<p>What inheritance structure is appropriate? What factors determine inheritance?</p>

<p>Sample Solution: The aim is to compare our solutions at the end of the course.</p>
