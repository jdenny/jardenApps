        Depending on [i]Question Style[/i], we speak the question or
        show it in the first coloured field (blue for English, red for Spanish);
        2nd field is a hint if relevant; 3rd field is for the answer. Think of
        your answer and press Go; we will fill in the correct
        answer and you then tell us if you got it right or not. If you are not
        sure of the spelling, you can type in the answer and we will mark it for
        you; self-mark mode only applies if the answer field is blank. If you want
        to check your Spanish pronunciation and you have Wi-Fi, you can press the
        microphone button and speak the answer; we will use Google speech
        recognition to try to decipher what you are saying. [a]Main[/a]

        Left swipe from side of screen to see main menu; long press on a button
        to show tip. Spanish has several words for [i]you[/i];
        to differentiate in English we use [i]thou[/i] for the familiar, and [i]YOU[/i]
        for the plural.\n

    <string name="NumbersGame">
        Listen to the numbers spoken in Spanish, and type in that number; if you
        get the number correct, your blue man will move forward; if the red man
        reaches the end before you, you have lost; if you get to the end before
        him, you go back to the beginning at the next level, where the red man
        gets slightly faster, and the questions get slightly harder. If you get
        caught, you can still continue to answer questions, but you will stay
        at the same level.

        Type in a word, either Spanish or English, and press [i]Go[/i] on the soft

        otherwise we show the definition of that word from the dictionary.

        The question is as shown in the top coloured line. Think of your answer (if the
        required answer is Spanish, ideally speak it aloud) and press Go and we will fill
        in the correct answer; you can then tell us if you got it right or not.
        Note: if you want to skip a word, just pretend you got it right!
        Alternatively type in your answer and press Go, and we will mark it for you.
        Self mark mode only works if the answer is blank.
