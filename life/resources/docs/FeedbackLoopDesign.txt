If proteins continued to consume all the available resources, Polymerase
would convert the nucleotides to RNA, and leave none for CopyDNA. With a
feedback loop, Polymerase would stop when there is enough RNA.

Feedback loop could be designed in one of two ways:
	Produce resources on demand:
	Ribosome asks for specific RNA or aminoAcid; not available; triggers
	 production of RNA (Polymerase)
	Polymerase asks for specific nucleotide; not available; triggers
	 EatFood and DigestFood.
	This doesn't seem to match real life, as some proteins would have to
	wait while we go and feed, but the proteins might well be the ones
	that give us the energy to feed!
or:
	Targets, so that protein stops when the target for that resource has
	been reached; e.g. digest only adds enough resources to targets, then
	discards the rest, and stops digesting until some of the resources are
	consumed. We'll go with this one!
