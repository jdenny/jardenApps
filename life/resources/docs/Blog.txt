---------------------
Much easier to build a template cell, rather than instructions to build;
cf knitting - pattern, few stitches, needles, can make anything - jumper,
socks, hat, toy; template for making a t-shirt - easier and quicker, but
can only make a t-shirt. Hence almost infinite variety built-in to the way
life has been designed. Could write a software program to make a copy of
itself - in Java a few [how many?] lines; but something driven by
instructions took many [how many?] lines.

Many times we had to redesign our approach - even doing our best to copy
the design of living cells - to make it work. Couldn't evolve towards it;
had to go back - dismantle some of the code - before we could go forward.

As design evolved, much obsolete code that we removed; any obsolete
machinery (proteins) or data (DNA) in cells?

Came to realise it's not just about DNA; there has to be a lot of machinery
in the cell to make it all work. Also, how come 20 simple molecules - amino
acids - can do so much, just by being chained together? Were these simple
molecules designed specifically for life?
