Notes 31 Jan 2017
need more detail about how it all works:
 does a whole chromosome get copied to RNA, or just part of it?
 does RNA get reused? how long does it last outside nucleus?
 does DNA have to be unravelled before it can be copied?
 how does RNA get out of nucleus?
 do I need to add a backbone to DNA & RNA?
 this is a big issue: how to construct a protein out of amino acids, where
  the behaviour of the protein is determined, in programmatic terms, from
  the properties of the amino acids!

Next target
-----------
Polymerase protein transcribes DNA (gene) into RNA, using spare nucleotides
Ribosome protein translates RNA into a protein, using spare amino acids

We need a protein for creating an amino acid (20 of?), and a protein for creating a
 nucleotide (5 of?)
We need a regulator protein for inhibiting the creation of each amino acid
	this attaches itself to the operator part of the DNA, to stop polymerase
	if the amino acid is running low, it releases itself from the DNA
Let's start off with:
	a protein for creating Adenine: CreateAdenine 
	@@ make this Uracil, CreateUracil, RegulateUracil
	@@ CreateUracil requires energy; read book!
	@@ manually add energy within MasterDesigner
	@@ then: dunno!
	a protein for regulating CreateAdenine,
		by attaching itself to the operator site of CreateAdenine DNA

------------------		

generic behaviour of a protein
a) create protein
	add amino-acid (or component protein!)
b) do work!
	for each amino-acid, perform void action();
some objects we pluck from the cell, floating around
sometimes the object we want is the next one in the chain

Each time a protein is created, start a thread. The protein looks for work to do, waits if
there isn't any, is notified when some becomes available, then does it.
e.g. Polymerase produces rna, then starts again.
Ribosome waits for rna; when it finds some, it makes it into a protein.

Make existing aminoAcids into proteins (big job!)

When a protein has finished with a molecule (e.g. aminoAcid) it must either destroy it
or return it to the cell's list.

Develop a user interface; should be able to
	view list of objects; select each object;
	view status of each object

Note we have to construct the first cell by hand; thereafter we should be able to
	create more cells!

for ribosome protein
	Codon GetCodonFromRNA()
		AminoAcid getAminoAcidFromCodon(Codon)
		null addAminoAcidToProtein(AminoAcid)
for polymerase protein
	Gene getGeneFromDNA()
		null getRNAFromGene(Gene)

one type of protein is a ribosome, whose action is to build a protein!
	obtain dna gene
	for each set of 3 sequential nucleotides (codon)
		grab corresponding amino acid (wait until one available?)
		attach amino acid to end of protein chain

other types of protein
	myosin, actin - motor (e.g. muscle)
	enzyme

Ideas for amino acids
	create ArrayList
	add object to arraylist;

We are in a classic 'chicken and egg' scenario; we need a ribosome to build a protein;
but a ribosome is a protein. Okay, we hand build the first one. A protein is made by
transcribing dna into RNA; this is done by RNA polymerase, which is a protein. Okay,
so we hand build the first ribosome and the first RNA polymerase, and the first DNA.
Now we can take the DNA, transcribe it into RNA (using RNA polymerase) and build our
first protein-built proteins.
