investigate warnings in code
improve protein status
make sure TestCell and MasterDesigner still work

Split amino acids into target 20!
  e.g. isChain(), hasMore() could be replaced by aminoAcid that
  simply sets a property on the protein: boolean isChain;
  isChain could then occur anywhere in the sequence, so not
  making a special 'control amino acid' from the first

need a protein to turn on/off a gene:
  find specified gene; change promoter code from "TATAAT" to "UATAAT" for off
  or vice versa for on; while we're waiting for this protein, do it manually!

Create nucleicAcid and aminoAcid from more basic raw materials,
instead of from existing cells
