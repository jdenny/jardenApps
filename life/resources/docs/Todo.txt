java.util.ConcurrentModificationException - why this is happening

LifeFX feed button awakens cell threads to update resources
then LifeFX tries to iterate through the resources to display them, this
  in the UI thread
we need to wait till the cell threads have finished; but...
what if cell threads are running indefinitely, which they could
  be if there was lots of food?
how about each time a cell is updated: the facts are passed via a
  callbacks to LifeFX:
    onNewCell(cell.id, generation);
    onCellUpdated(cellData); CellData is: cell.id, array of protein.name & ct,
      array of aminoAcid.name & ct, array of nucleicAcid.name & ct)
  normalMethod in Cell:
    CellData getCellData(cell.id); // save cell.id; notify via callback
      if this cell changes
  see penciled diagram! Note: only need to notify if selected cell has changed
  or new one added.

investigate warnings in code
improve protein status
make sure TestCell and MasterDesigner still work

need a protein to turn on/off a gene:
  find specified gene; change promoter code from "TATAAT" to "UATAAT" for off
  or vice versa for on; while we're waiting for this protein, do it manually!

Create nucleicAcid and aminoAcid from more basic raw materials,
instead of from existing cells

Split amino acids into target 20! *****************************
  e.g. isChain(), hasMore() could be replaced by aminoAcid that
  simply sets a property on the protein: boolean isChain;
  isChain could then occur anywhere in the sequence, so not
  making a special 'control amino acid' from the first

Single molecules
	nucleicAcid
	aminoAcid

chain = findChain(type) // type=DNA, RNA, Protein; may wait
element = findResource(type, name) // name=<aminoAcidName>, <nucleotideName>
chain.moveToStart()
element = chain.getNext() // or null for end
element = chain.removeCurrent()
chain.add(element) // also removes it from chain or free list

removeAminoAcid()
attachAminoAcid - to protein
detatch object from chain
findDNAChain()
moveToNext

Current aminoAcids******************
polymerase
    FindNextGene
    	get DNA
    	find start of gene (promoter)
    GetRNAFromGene
    	wait for required 3 nucleotides
    	add to RNA
    	repeat until end of gene (stop)
ribosome
	GetCodonFromRNA
		if no RNA: waitForRNA
		get next codon
		move to new position
		return codon

		hasMore: if some RNA and not at end
	GetAminoAcidFromCodon
		if stop codon:
			add protein to cell
		else:
			waitForAminoAcid
			add aminoAcid to protein
	AddAminoAcidToProtein
		(incorporated into GetAminoAcidFromCodon)

digestFood
	DigestFood
		wait for food
		get nucleotides
		for each: add to cell
		get DNA
		for each nucleotide: add to cell
		get aminoAcids
		for each: add to cell
		get proteins
		for each:
			get aminoAcids
			for each: add to cell

divideCell
	DivideCell
		only run if another divideCell not running
		wait until enough proteins to divide
		copy DNA:
			for each nucleotide pair:
				wait for matching nucleotide
		for each protein > base proteins:
			stop protein
			move to new cell



20 aminoAcids **********************
attach to matching resource; perhaps use some
aminoAcids to identify resourceType

move to next element in chain

add created resource (e.g. protein) to cell
