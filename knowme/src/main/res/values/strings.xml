    <string name="aboutKnowMe">The aim is to see how well you
        and a friend know each other. You each need to be running this game on your
        own Android device. You will be asked a series of questions, with
        multi-choice answers. Guess what your friend will say, then give your own answer
        - the one you think is the best description of you. When you have both answered,
        the game will tell you if you guessed correctly.</string>
    <string name="aboutSingleDevice">Alternatively, you can play on a
