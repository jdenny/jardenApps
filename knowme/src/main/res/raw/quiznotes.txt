In bluetooth, in close() method, use interrupt() to interrupt a thread
I the preferred way to stop a runnable object to call close(), which in turn sets a flag which the while-loop examines (used to be this way)? Or is it to set the interrupt flag outside, and in runnable to do while(!isInterrupted())

NOTE: not sure if I've already done the following; need to check
create a simple app with 1 activity and 2 fragments
menu options to show each fragment
find out what happens when: rotate; run a new app and return

onCreate()
	if savedInstanceState:
		set currentFragmentId to saved state
		set currentFragment to ? // see above!
	else:
		set currentFragmentId to clock
		set currentFragment to null

onResume()
	showFragment()

showFragment()
	get fragment from currentFragmentId
	if currentFragment == fragment: return
	currentFragment.stop();
	currentFragment.hide();
	currentFragment = fragment;
	if currentFragment == bluetoothFragment:
		add to fragmentContainer
	else:
		currentFragment.show();
	currentFragment.start();
