    <string name="disturbed">
        In disturbed auction, no [a]relay[/a], no [a]sandpit[/a], no

    <string name="Double">
        [b]Takeout double[/b] (in book called offensive double, as still expecting

        defensive (aka values or penalties) double, where we expect to defend and
        subsequently defeat the contract.

        \nIf question is multiple bids, explain meaning of last bid.
        \nMultiple bids separated by commas for each round; rounds
        are separated by semi-colons, e.g. 1C, 1H; 1S means partner
        bid 1C, you bid 1H, partner\'s 2nd bid was 1S; you have to
        explain his 1S.
        \nIf they bid, their bids are shown in brackets, e.g.
        1C, (1S), double means you bid 1C, opponent bid 1S, your partner
        doubled; explain his double.
