CARDS
To Test
	bluetooth still works - but how is it to be used now?
To-Do:
	stay on same hand if rotate or go to another app
	lastBid, bidList, westDeal, primaryBid, bidNumber should
		all be in business class, not presentation class; also keep
		track of 3 consecutive passes
	align east to right of screen

AMAZEQUIZ
merge in QuizRace:
	add AnagramQuiz; sort out why Files not working; option with no race!
	input type to be text or number; don't throw any exceptions!
	add 'Go' button to keyboard; delete QuizRace
	try out wi-fi direct: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifip2p.html
possibly move QuestionStyle and AnswerStyle out of Quiz and put into User,
	as done by EngSpaQuiz2

SPANISH
engspa.txt
	remove hockey?
	guitar, qualifier from time to music
	comedor shouldn't be food
	in the morning?
	more phrases
	get rid of obvious words; add words from GCSE book
	Should faltar be lack rather than miss?
	are we using gustar correctly?
	sort words in engspa.txt, to reflect school words; complete GCSE words
	split big topics into 2 or 3 groups, e.g. building, building1, building2;
		for hint, remove number at end

small changes
* when click on x (delete field) set focus
* numbers game, change button to Start; when started, change it to Restart
	add Pass button?
* ! at beginning of imperatives; see engSpaFragment.normalise()
* try answer field without single line
* Spoken numbers don't work come out as eg 5 not cinco
* try context menu as long click - see QAANDDEV, Menus (07) slide 9
* try passing parameters to Fragments view Bundle - see QAANDDEV, module 15, slide 10 notes
* Catch connection error and output more sensible message
* should we check we can connect before connecting to a server?
	See QAANDDEV, mod 11, slide 4
* when we're not sure of the order of creation of some objects, could we put
	some code in Fragment.onActivityCreated()?
* back button when showing navigation drawer should close navigation drawer
* rename numbers game to gato y ratón?

big changes
* phrase generator: "the [noun] is in the [building or place]"
	adjectives and adverbs, e.g. the green bus; el autobus verde; he ran quickly
	I go to the city by bus; conjugate go; use any place, not just city;
		metro, bike, car, coach etc; see page 39 of GCSE book
	go to [place,noun] by [travel] - but needs some work!
* in practice mode, with more than 5 fails, pop-up option to "revise recent fails?"
* layouts for other devices: nexus 7, note 3; landscape; keyboard showing
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16411056/how-to-adjust-layout-when-soft-keyboard-appears
	on Cara’s motorg phone, tool bar hides part of “revise spanish” of drawer menu
* should audio mode continue after screen turns off? should it be run as a Service?
* review style; get input from Joe boy; follow Material design patterns:
	layout, fonts, icons, e.g. https://design.google.com/icons/index.html
    Sam-style progress bar?
* some verbs only 3rd person singular, e.g. to snow
* for countries and towns and nationalities don't add article
* when loading new dictionary, show how much progress we have made so far
  	based on size of dictionary file

long term
* design.txt (writing this will incorporate a code review)
* close keyboard on click away, like ios; google for "hide soft keyboard on android
	after clicking outside EditText"
* test harness! check Log messages; check TODOs
* remove user from database
* all fragments should survive screen rotation
* optionally split verb into two stages: infinitive then conjugate
	e.g. Q: I will eat; A: comer; right, now try to conjugate or wrong try again
* in debug app, have fragment that allows us to fire SQL to database
	and invoke methods of EngSpaDAO
* extra tenses: reflexive, I have eaten (present perfect),
	I had eaten (past perfect or pluperfect)

TODO: merge these todos with lists above!
outstanding tests
	test invalid value for one of enums in engspa.txt
	only turn on textToSpeech if question style requires it
	if not noun or verb, and attribute is n_a: use word type as hint
	Combine status fields and stats into one
	accent error not working
Short-term
	Sam's icon as title of drawer
	have search icon in toolBar (was actionBar) as alternative to enter
		Word Search; fill in drop-down of words as user types into search
		rename VerbTableFragment to WordSearchFragment
		see http://developer.android.com/training/appbar/action-views.html
Long-term
	need a way to force reload of DB, from built-in or from web site
		in case load from server fails
	use same dialog or fragment for updating user in JardenProviders & Spanish
	random mode (when reached max level): set EngSpaQuiz.questionSequence to AAF
	re-factor EngSpaContract.QuestionStyle to be like the other enums
	have main dictionary in JardenProviders (or perhaps better in Spanish),
		plus extra text file(s) online; document why do we need a dictionary,
		instead of set of text files like BKH.
		as words mature, they can migrate to JardenProviders;
		this would require an extra column on the database, but we
		could use the now redundant LEVEL - see EngSpaQuiz.setUserLevel()
		Note that if we set words from main file to LEVEL=1, and words
		from extra file to LEVEL=2, when we updated the extra file we
		would have to delete all words with LEVEL=2, and reset nextID
		to numberOfRows + 1
	extend verbTable menu option to include all words:
		menu verbTable -> Word Lookup; search for English or Spanish, as now,
		but some kind of auto-completion and/or wild cards in search
		if verb chosen, option to show conjugation; search menu option
		on toolbar; button to speak selected word
	change EngSpa.Attribute from enum to a String?
	for time and dates and places, use preposition, e.g.
		last Tuesday; at five o'clock; next June; to England; at the chemist
	make Spanish pronoun optional
	after successful DB update show how many rows inserted
		after failed update, dialog to ask if want to retry or restore to
		factory-installed version
	add checkBox to Activity Menu: "Verbs Only" (i.e. not in user settings, as it's temporary)
