AMAZEQUIZ
merge in QuizRace:
	add AnagramQuiz; sort out why Files not working; option with no race!
	input type to be text or number; don't throw any exceptions!
	add 'Go' button to keyboard; delete QuizRace
	try out wi-fi direct: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifip2p.html
possibly move QuestionStyle and AnswerStyle out of Quiz and put into User,
	as done by EngSpaQuiz2

SPANISH
Main Quiz Logic ************************************************
clean open of app
	getUser (level, quizMode, qaStyle)
	new EngSpaQuiz(DAO, user)
		save DAO & user
		modeInitialised = false
	quiz.resetMode()
		get questions based on user settings
	open engSpaFragment
	engSpaFrag.askQuestion(true), i.e. get and ask next question

set level or set quizMode
	quiz.reset

engSpaFragment.onResume
	nothing!

significant events:
	new Quiz
	quiz.setQuizMode
	new EngSpaFragment (from mainActivity)
	engSpaFra.createView - savedInstance may be null or not
	engSpaFra -> getNextQuestion

	from users viewpoint
		start app from scratch
		return to app after other app, rotate, timeout
		change level or quizMode
Notes: may not use Quiz! (audio mode or numbers game or word lookup)

Proposed Design
---------------
remove USER_LEVEL_ALL; in userDialog, if number too big:
	"level > maximum; to include words from all levels, select
	practice mode from main menu"

new EngSpaQuiz: modeInitialised = false
EngSpaQuiz.setLevel
	can't set level to 1 if practice or audio mode
	modeInitialised = false
EngSpaQuiz.setQuizMode(mode)
	modeInitialised = false
	engSpaUser.setQuizMode(mode)
EngSpaQuiz.getNextQuestion
	if (!modeInitialised)
		resetMode (including Topic mode)
		modeInitialised = true
MainActivity.selectMode
	can't select learnMode if level > maxLevel

End of main Quiz Logic *****************************************

New ideas on qaStyle: *************************************************
qaStyle:
	1. spoken & written spa-eng (was 5)
	2. written eng-spa
	3. spoken spa-eng
	4. written spa-eng (was 1)
	5. spoken spa-spa (was 4)
	random 1 to 5
	alternate 2 & 3
learn mode; CFPCF; for each level:
	C = phase 1: qaStyle 1
		phase 2: qaStyle 2
	P = random words from previous levels,
		based on user.qaStyle
		NOTE: current code uses same style as C for P
	F = fails, using style saved in failed word
practice mode (only applicable where learnLevel > 1)
	PF, where P & F same as learn mode
	does not progress levels
audio mode: (learnLevel > 1)
	speaks both english and spanish with pauses
	P = as for learn mode
topic mode; CFPCF:
	C & P = user.qaStyle
	F = as for learn mode
	NOTE: should C be same as learn?

Summary
	P always uses user.qaStyle
	F always uses style saved in failed word
	C only applies to Learn & Topic
		learn: 1 for phase 1, 2 for phase 2


new navigation drawer:
	learn mode: CFPCF; current from learnLevel
	----------
	question style
	topic mode: CF[PCF]; current from topic
	practice mode: PF
	-----------
	audio mode: P
	word lookup
	numbers game
	exit

learn mode design
	EngSpaQuiz
		setMode(learnMode)
			set cfpList to CFPCF
			get current words at learnLevel
			get failed words
		setMode(practiceMode)
			set cfpList to PF
			get failed words; options:
				as is; don't remove from memory copy until 3 right; extra button to
				reload fails from DB?
		setMode(audioMode)
			set cfpList to P
			get failed words
		setMode(topicMode)
			set cfpList to CF
			get current words from topic
			get failed words
		setLevel(level)
			-> setMode(learnMode)
		getNextQuestion2()
			if learnMode or topicMode
				if end of questions
					if learnMode: next level
					else: next topic
	note: learn, practice & topic modes all use EngSpaFragment

decisions so far:
	default mode to be new 1
	alternate 2 & 3 only applies up to current level

strategy
	update alternate to only apply up to current level, i.e. not increment level
	and only random completed words, and alternating between new 1 and 2 above
	add audio mode; try it alternating

end of New ideas on qaStyle: *************************************************
* both fields can be red on word lookup!
* check Log messages; check TODOs
* put new screen shots onto developer console
* don't repeat speech after rotate
* status option: level, quizMode, qaStyle, fails, currents
* Can lose track of question count
* At end of level can ask question twice
* follow Material design patterns: layout, fonts, icons,
	e.g. https://design.google.com/icons/index.html
* Back from numbers sometimes exits app
* Long press should turn on showHelp
* should audio mode continue after screen turns off?
* Padding around text
Sam-style progress bar
! at beginning of imperatives; see engSpaFragment.normalise()
try answer field without single line
Add more mf's eg soltero,
Spoken numbers don't work come out as eg 5 not cinco
Delete button appears when you start typing
Numbers game: pass button; in field width.
margins

! At start of imperatives
Should faltar be lack rather than miss?
* remove option for multiple users
	add new class that holds level, raceLevel, qaStyle, quizMode,
		learnModePhase (1 or 2)
	keeps in sync with sharedPreferences
	done except for database!
* help fragment creating document text view every time; use retain instance etc;
* rename numbers game to gato y ratÃ³n
* all fragments should survive screen rotation
* are we using gustar correctly?

No help for word lookup; still got it's own status field
Numbers game: no help; got its own status field
Replace and with phrase
Selecting topic or qastyle or questions by level should open main window
set title & helpText of each fragment in onCreateView

ideas from demo to Julie

	Write a complete user-guide as a Google Doc, and use that as the basis for the help.

	Status: loading dictionary - please wait
	HelpDocument: userGuide

check with Joe: 1 user? bluetooth?

when we add > 1 user, don't forget to save showHelp as part of user
(but still update it via showHelpCheckbox, not user dialog)

check duolingo to see if we actually need to cater for more than 1 user!

different layouts for landscape!
optionally split verb into two stages: infinitive then conjugate
	e.g. Q: I will eat; A: comer; right, now try to conjugate or wrong try again
each tip automatically stops after 3 shows?

Show qaStyle
Catch connection error and output more sensible message

get rid of obvious words; add words from GCSE book
add long press everywhere?
different layout when keyboard shows

in debug app, have fragment that allows us to fire SQL to database
	and invoke methods of EngSpaDAO

save the current level of race game; remember last topic in EngSpaUser
extra tenses: reflexive, I have eaten (present perfect),
	I had eaten (past perfect or pluperfect)
some verbs only 3rd person singular, e.g. to snow
reset function, on overflow menu:
	delete all userwords, shared preferences
for countries and towns and nationalities don't add article
write a proper test suite!
when loading new dictionary, show how much progress we have made so far
	based on size of dictionary file

help page with hyperlinks: see BKH and
	http://www.androidengineer.com/2010/08/easy-method-for-formatting-android.html
allow for multiple users; set userName to 'admin', to allow extra features?

see TODOs
outstanding tests
	test invalid value for one of enums in engspa.txt
	only turn on textToSpeech if question style requires it
	if not noun or verb, and attribute is n_a: use word type as hint
	Combine status fields and stats into one
	accent error not working
Short-term
	sort words in engspa.txt, to reflect school words; complete GCSE words
	split big topics into 2 or 3 groups, e.g. building, building1, building2;
		for hint, remove number at end
	Sam's icon as title of drawer
	have search icon in toolBar (was actionBar) as alternative to enter
		Word Search; fill in drop-down of words as user types into search
		rename VerbTableFragment to WordSearchFragment
		see http://developer.android.com/training/appbar/action-views.html
Long-term
	need a way to force reload of DB, from built-in or from web site
		in case load from server fails
	use same dialog or fragment for updating user in JardenProviders & Spanish
	random mode (when reached max level): set EngSpaQuiz.questionSequence to AAF
	re-factor EngSpaContract.QuestionStyle to be like the other enums
	have main dictionary in JardenProviders (or perhaps better in Spanish),
		plus extra text file(s) online; document why do we need a dictionary,
		instead of set of text files like BKH.
		as words mature, they can migrate to JardenProviders;
		this would require an extra column on the database, but we
		could use the now redundant LEVEL - see EngSpaQuiz.setUserLevel()
		Note that if we set words from main file to LEVEL=1, and words
		from extra file to LEVEL=2, when we updated the extra file we
		would have to delete all words with LEVEL=2, and reset nextID
		to numberOfRows + 1
	extend verbTable menu option to include all words:
		menu verbTable -> Word Lookup; search for English or Spanish, as now,
		but some kind of auto-completion and/or wild cards in search
		if verb chosen, option to show conjugation; search menu option
		on toolbar; button to speak selected word
	change EngSpa.Attribute from enum to a String?
	for time and dates and places, use preposition, e.g.
		last Tuesday; at five o'clock; next June; to England; at the chemist
	make Spanish pronoun optional
	after successful DB update show how many rows inserted
		after failed update, dialog to ask if want to retry or restore to
		factory-installed version
	add checkBox to Activity Menu: "Verbs Only" (i.e. not in user settings, as it's temporary)
Original design spec:
	start work on new player fragment
		show existing players; add, update, delete player
		for new player, determine current level, and preferred
			question style; explain menu options
		save player level & fail data
		save user's preference for question type
	check can handle > 1 player
	
	abandon questionType (word, phrase, sentence) and add more phrases
		(and sentences!) to database
	long hold over anything pops up help text; explain this
		in introduction
	extend Provider to add search and sort criteria
	option to choose words from selected category, like in Python
	add id to wordFile, so when update database it still matches
	option to show fails as ListView; could select from them
		to choose next word
	check for duplicates when loading database
	free-standing java app to update and validate data file
		if duplicates, allow for alternative translations
	add level two words; see http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primarylanguages/spanish/all_about_me/colours/
	word (default), phrase, sentence
		word: the/a lion; he will eat; slowly; red; under // done
		phrase: the/a red lion; he will slowly eat
		sentence: the red lion will slowly eat a cow
	check if typed in wrong language? difficult!
	proper database design: have table for each type (wordType, qualifier, attribute)
		e.g. WordTypes = { int id, String wordType}
		this ensures database integrity, reduces size of DB, and saves me validating
		the ContentValues.
		This also gives us the option to get the types for the spinners from the DB!
		(like we did in Django/Python)
		See https://gate.ac.uk/

IMPROVEMENTS OVER AMAZEQUIZ
random files of Spanish now on SQLite database
proper concept of levels for PresetQuiz
learnLevel held on database
improved algorithm for choosing next question
	user decides how many goes to have per word
	number of required rights based on number of wrongs
		at current level and previous levels
algorithm for establishing level of new user - not yet implemented!

SpanishQuiz requirements
----------------------------------------------
choose one of:
	1. word, verb phrase (e.g. we were eating), or phrase (e.g. the dog was eating the green carrot)
Note: generate random, but grammatically correct Spanish phrases

Use Cases:
	1. speak Spanish -> type Spanish
	2. speak Spanish -> type English
	3. speak & print Spanish -> type English
	4. print Spanish -> type English
	5. print English -> type Spanish
	6. random: any of above

Go: if no input, show answer
	if input
		check answer & mark accordingly (see below)
		if wrong ask question again (i.e. repeat until correct or no input)
		allow alternative answers 

Radio: word, verb phrase, sentence
Spinner: see use cases above
questionTextView
answerEditText
goButton, repeatButton (only applicable to use cases 1-3)

ability to download extra dictionary elements from web site
	i.e. similar to AmazeQuiz
	at start of app, check can connect to my server
	if so, check date of EngSpa.dat; if newer give user option to download new version
	also provide (menu?) option to download new version

objectives:
	suitable app for schools
	POC for using Scala and Python in Android
	help me with my Spanish

PLAN
done: textToSpeech; sqlite; conjugate verbs; download new words;
	replace Contract with EngSpaContract
	add extra fields to engSpa: attribute, difficulty
	return QuestionAnswer, instead of trashing EngSpa!
	refresh EngSpaList when database updated
	validate values for insert and update; this should be done
		using extra tables on database, e.g. WordTypes.
	restore database
	calculate student level - see levelAlgorithm.txt

PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
EngSpaQuiz replace by Levels
	List<EngSpa> etc, as for Levels
