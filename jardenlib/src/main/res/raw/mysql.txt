old message, now superceded I think:
	currently getting ERROR 1040 (HY000): Too many connections
	when log in as john; okay as root; need to set privileges for John?
I can log into client utility as root, but not as anything else; if I create other users,
they work from WebLogic connection pools; note that the fully qualified name of a table
is database.schema.table; in mysql, there is no schema, only database; so if the database
referred to in the connection pool URL is john, table phonebook is implicitly john.phonebook.

Client utility
--------------
login
	cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\bin
	mysql -u root -p [mysql]
	or: mysql -u john -p [john2010]
useful commands
	select user(), version(), current_date, database();
	show databases; show tables;
	create user john@johnsT500 identified by 'john2010';
	grant all privileges on *.* to john@johnsT500;
	grant all privileges on johndb.* to 'john'@'johnslaptop';
	drop user john@johnsT500;
	exit;
	show [global|session] {variables|status} like '%connect%';
